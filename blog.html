                <h3>Describe the difference between sessionStorage, localStorage?</h3>
                <p>
                    The difference between sessionStorage and localStorage is that localStorage data does not expire,
                    whereas sessionStorage data is cleared when the page session ends. A unique page session gets
                    created once a document is loaded in a browser tab. Page sessions are valid for only one tab at a
                    time.

                <h3>Explain the differnce between global scope and block scope in javascript?</h3>
                <p>
                    In a browser environment, the global scope is controlled by the window object while in Node. js,
                    it's controlled by the global object. Block scopes are what you get when you use if statements, for
                    statements, and the like.

                <h3> How a Event Loop works in JavaScript? </h3>
                <p>The Event Loop has one simple job â€” to monitor the Call Stack and the Callback Queue. If the Call
                    Stack is empty, the Event Loop will take the first event from the queue and will push it to the Call
                    Stack, which effectively runs it. Such an iteration is called a tick in the Event Loop.</p>
